# Kraken_ALU
⚙️ A modular, 16-bit Verilog ALU supporting arithmetic and bitwise operations, built from custom adders and designed for integration into a RISC-style CPU. Includes testbenches and waveform visualization.

 Title       : ALU_Project.v
 Author      : Akshat Singh
 Description : 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting AND, OR, XOR, NOT,
             ADD (with carry select), SUB, SLT, and NAND operations.

 Notes       :
     - Custom full adder-based ripple adder (add16)
     - Carry-select optimization in upper 16-bits
     - Bitwise NOT and XOR as modular Verilog
     - Signed SLT operation implemented using Verilog's signed comparison
     - Original naming and structure for clarity and reuse
